# Command: feature

**Usage:** `/($)i-wf feature <description> [--type <feature|bug|refactor|optimization>]`

Intake a new feature: collect all requirements, decompose into chunks, scaffold the folder. The feature command is the root of truth — any gap here cascades into every stage downstream.

## Steps

1. **Parse args.** Extract `<description>` and `--type`. If `--type` is missing, ask the user: `feature | bug | refactor | optimization`.

2. **Check `superpowers:brainstorming` skill.** Hard stop if not installed:
   `Required: superpowers:brainstorming — install it first.`

3. **Invoke `superpowers:brainstorming`** to deeply explore the feature with the user.

4. **Ambiguity rule.** If anything is unclear — scope, acceptance criteria, edge cases — stop and ask the user. Do not proceed with assumptions. Resolve 100% of ambiguities before scaffolding.

5. **Decompose into sequential chunks** following these rules:
   - Chunks are strictly sequential — chunk N+1 cannot start until chunk N is integrated
   - Each chunk is a vertical slice: frontend + backend + API + DB as needed
   - Each chunk declares only the stages it needs

   | Chunk type | Typical stages |
   |---|---|
   | New UI (feature) | `design → code → qa → integrate` |
   | Backend / API / optimization | `code → qa → integrate` |
   | Bug fix | `code → qa → integrate` |
   | Pure refactor | `code → qa → integrate` |
   | Config / infra | `code → integrate` |

   Each acceptance criterion must be testable (verifiable pass/fail). Never accept vague criteria like "make it look nice" — get specifics.

6. **Present the decomposition** and wait for user approval:
   ```
   Proposed decomposition for "<description>" (--type <type>):

   01-<chunk-slug>: <description>
     Stages: design → code → qa → integrate
     Acceptance criteria:
       - <specific, testable criterion>
       - <specific, testable criterion>

   02-<chunk-slug>: <description>
     Stages: code → qa → integrate
     Acceptance criteria:
       - <criterion>

   Reply `approve` to scaffold exactly this decomposition.
   Adjust: describe changes in chat.
   ```

7. **On explicit in-chat approval**, generate feature ID: `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>`. Do not treat `/($)i-wf advance` as approval here; `advance` is stage-only.

8. **Create feature branch** from `main`:
   - `bug` type → `hotfix/<feature-id>`
   - all other types → `wf/<feature-id>`

9. **Ensure `preproduction` is up to date** with `main` (create from `main` if absent).

10. **Scaffold feature folder** from templates (copy and fill placeholders):
    - `docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/feature.md`
    - `docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/INDEX.md`
    - `docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/chunks.md`
    - `docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/log.md`
    - `docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/screenshots/` (empty folder with `.gitkeep`)

11. **Update `docs/workflow/INDEX.md`** — add a row under Active features.

12. **Commit scaffold on `preproduction`:**
    ```bash
    git add docs/workflow/
    git commit -m "chore(workflow): scaffold feature <feature-id>"
    ```

13. **Print:**
    ```
    Feature <feature-id> scaffolded — N chunks.
    Start: /($)i-wf run <feature-id>
    ```

## Acceptance criteria for this command

Before scaffolding, verify:
- `superpowers:brainstorming` was invoked
- Feature type is declared
- All ambiguities resolved — no open questions
- Every chunk has specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Every chunk has a declared stage list matching its type
- All aspects of the user's request are covered by at least one chunk
- User explicitly approved the decomposition before any scaffold files were created
